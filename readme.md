### It's time to be the sexy back in Senso!


Well all know that Senso is classy. Like damn, can I get some coffee with that class? I mean, my credit card is served back to me on a freaking fresco platter when they are done taking a meager sum for the sweet black goodness I receive in return. 

This is not what it should be - http://caffesensounico.com/. 

That being said, I think it's time to do something about it. How else will the pastries and sandwiches there get sold out in 10 seconds flat?

I propose we create a new site for Cafe Senso, host it on Github's [gh-pages](http://pages.github.com/) and offer it to Mario himself. If he doesn't like it, so be it, but we'll have a damn good time doing something awesome.

Development has started and you can view the page here - http://dalanmiller.github.com/sensolicious/

To modify the files, you'll need to pull down the branch via `git pull origin gh-pages:gh-pages` I believe. And then when you push back, just do `git push origin gh-pages`.
